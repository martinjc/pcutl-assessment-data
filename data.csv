COMSC,CMT112,Course Website Creation,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,1,learnt enough skills to complete it and can get help from teachers,1,,"can test if you can apply these skills, you learn better than essays and examinations but maybe weak in theory and some rules ",
COMSC,CMT112,Course Website Creation,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,1,"Coupled with additional materials, it is just a matter of time in completing the coursework. Also, online material helps too",1,It is practical to give students space/coursework to apply skills they've acquired,Strengths: allow students to apply the skills that they have learned - Weakness: it takes time and a lot of guidance for students to complete the coursework as opposed to exams,nothing
COMSC,CMT112,Course Website Creation,5,4,4,4,4,4,5,1,clear direction and explanation on coursework sheet,1,"It will examine whether students have learned or not, and that's the major goal for course assessment","Stregnths: practising skills learned, Making creation that could be shown to others. Weaknesses: nothing much","The topic, which was set on MSc courses could be wider. It is a little bit boring to make a website for our courses (sorry but it's true)"
COMSC,CMT112,Course Website Creation,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,1,The course was broken down into weeks learning different and new wlements which allowed me to grasp the material far more easily,1,It teaches you something implicitly and then tests what you have learned in a very short period of time,"Strengths: material was explained well, examples provided lots of online videos allowed content to be learned outside of lectures; Weaknesses: Course content was very heavy, steep learning curve which did not allow for higher marks in a short space of time",More coursework sessions where you can work on coursework and get aid if you get stuck. This enables you to consider more challenging projects
COMSC,CMT112,Course Website Creation,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,1,Lectures were thorough with plenty of practical time to get to grips with what was covered. A lot of extra learning material was provided and interactivity between lecturer and student was good,1,It ensures that the student actually understands what they are doing and provides a great deal of practice time with the subject matter,Strengths: a lot of flexibility granted to give the student freedom of creativity and the ability to add what they want into the website. Excellent lectures and support material provided. Ample time given to complete work; Weaknesses: Some best practices not covered beforehand (e.g. use of single CSS sheet),"A more open-ended project  would have been more engaging rather than having to make a website for a specific subject. However, this more accurately represents tasks likely to be given to a web developer"
COMSC,CMT112,Course Website Creation,5,5,,,,,,,,1,"For learning how to build web applications actually building them is the best way to do this. Although written exams in computer languages are probably more academically rigorous when the aim is to learn that language, it is more important that the module takes its end goal into account when deciding how to assess students.","Very good introduction to building a website and testing code, but little emphasis on some of the great pains taken just before launching a real website e.g cross browser testing (wasn't required)",Some useful tools for the project were given after the coursework was handed out which may have led to developing bad practices from the start for some people. It may be useful to hand out the coursework later otherwise starting early has few benefits
COMSC,CMT112,Course Website Creation,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,1,yass,1,sure,strength: limited content choices make resulting websites comparable; weakness: limited content choice does not inspire creative design approach,it's fine the way it is I guess
COMSC,CMT112,Course Website Creation,5,5,4,4,4,3,3,1,,1,,limited choice of subject matter was not exactly motivating. Difficult to feel enthusiastic about. I suppose this does allow one ti concentrate on technical aspects and not content creation,"perhaps  a limited set of choices that are less prosaic and don't demand such generic, corporate design"
COMSC,CMT112,Course Website Creation,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,1,,1,yes it needed a lot of attention and focus,"I don't think you will learn as much as you did doing the project if you had given an exam. That was a positive, can't think of any weaknesses","Wouldn't change anything, was good as it was. Learnt a lot in the process"
COMSC,CMT112,Course Website Creation,5,4,5,5,5,3,3,1,We were given enough information in lectures to help us research and explore the topics more fully in our own time to complete the assessment effectively,3,,It helped develop basic and fundamental web coding skills that would be a crucial foundation to future skills development. A sense of accomplishment as students made something that could be use and was entirely theirs. Perhaps a more interesting web theme to encourage more creativity and depth of learning,The theme + topic of website creation
COMSC,CMT112,Course Website Creation,4,4,4,4,3,4,3,1,The mark scheme was clear and the skills taught in class were sufficient to complete the assignment,3,,"The design aspect is very subjective, especially the physical appearance of the website","A bit more detail about what was required in the written report would have been useful. Anything that requires reflection or self-evaluation is, again, very subjective, so a few more pointers may have been helpful"
COMSC,CMT112,Course Website Creation,4,4,4,4,3,5,4,3,,1,,Strengths: useful; Weakness: takes too much time to complete,More guidance in the tutorial sessions. Cover more topics in the lectures
COMSC,CMT112,Course Website Creation,4,5,4,5,5,5,3,1,Taught in a lab. This drastically improves learning,2,,Strength: using our own knowlesge as well as taught and researched time to utilise all skills and be creative,The first coursework being specifically about the course. A few more choices would have made it a little more interesting
COMSC,CMT112,Course Website Creation,5,4,4,5,4,5,5,1,A good combination of theory in lectures and practical tasks in labs allowed me to complete the assessment successfully so I feel I had the appropriate amount of guidance,1,Due to the course being based on practical skillsets I feel that a task such as this is perhaps a better indicator of the skills being developed that a written assessment,Strengths were that it allowed us to cememnt the knowledge we obtained in lectures and labs. While difficult it was not out of our depth. Weaknesses were that it was early on so could be seen as too demanding for sure.,Nothing
CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,4,2,4,4,2,5,5,3,,3,Depends on how technical you are,S=could work with others W=those who lacked technical ability struggled,The way the groups are marked
CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,4,3,5,4,4,5,5,3,We did not ask for guidance,1,Challenging but fun. Lots of research etc needed,S=it was very enjoyable to work as a chosen group. I had a good group. Different skills needed to complete the work. W=took a long time to complete,More time needed to work on the project
CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,2,2,3,2,1,5,5,2,None at all,,What?,"S=was different W=it was all down to one person to actually make the film. So difficult, focused more on little techy things than actually learning",Not to do the film project
CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,4,2,4,2,1,5,5,2,Not enough help with clarity of aims and filming,3,Don't understand the question,"S=learnt how to make a film W=very time consuming, group mark unfair when some members of the group don't participate, filming skills will never be used again",Choose our groups or individual mark
CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,4,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,The content of the video needed to be better explained as we left out methods/information we felt weren't relevant which we were marked down on,2,"The randomised group I was put in had 3 people who worked hard (myself included), one who did bare minimum and one who failed to turn up to meeting, and fufill his part of the assessment yet we all got the same mark",S=it provided a different form of assessment keeping things interesting W=it allowed for mismatch of work load,Be able to choose the groups and more in depth brief of what should be included
CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,4,2,4,3,2,4,5,2,Didn't know the criteria we were marked on. Also had no support during computer lab sessions led to unecessary waste of time,2,It was a small period of time reflecting 100% of module. Also groups weren't marked fairly. If we were told it had to be 6 mins why did one group get a 1st for an 8 min film. A lot more info could be covered in 2 mins,S=was different form of assessment W=not all members of the group fully participated. Not a fair assessment,Choose own groups. Have session with lecturers on how to actually use the software.
CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,4,2,4,2,2,4,3,2,Didn't understand relevance of projects,2,Didn't improve my knowledge of the research methods module,S=it improved my knowledge of making a film W=it took alot of time arranging to meet with people who did not live nearby and who I didn't know very well,Being able to pick own groups
CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,We didn't really have any basic examples on which to base our films on (even an example of a bad/low-grade film would have been good),2,Not answered,"S=it was a different form of project so it meantwe had to think slightly more creatively W=the task was still kind of simple, meaning that there was a lot of scope to do whatever you wanted & so it was difficult to understand what we were being marked on exactly",Not answered
CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,4,2,4,3,2,5,4,2,More time on how to use the software. More clarity on marking criteria. Example film shown.,2,Time limit too short to include a critical engagement with material. Could only offer a superficial understanding of material given the time limit of film is not well suited to presenting  critical literature review.,S=good way to engage with different people in the year. New skills developed. Allowed you to think creatively. W=difficult to offer critical engagement with material given the time limit on the video,Have a separate literature review that is written. Allow a greater time limit. Offer an example film or a clearer marking criteria.
CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,5,5,5,4,5,1,2,1,The brief was sufficient to guide us & information given in lectures/lab sessions,1,For the nature of assessment it allowed us to demonstrate the skills which wouldn't be as possible in an essay,S=it allowed us to demonstrate our skills. It is realistic that in future we will do work with people who we don't know & I thought that was a good way to learn those skills. W=hard to reference & struggled to make it look professional,Nothing
CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,1,Except more time learning video editing software would have been appreciated.,2,Trying to reference in the video was hard. The time limit of the video was too short to be rigorous.,S=good for working in new groups/meet new people W=topic was too similar to modules in first year - felt like we'd already done the research before = not the most interesting,More practical lessons on the video editing software beforehand = would have made it look more professional
CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,4,3,4,2,2,3,3,2,Didn't understand relevance,2,Felt it was unfair a whole module worth of credits accounted for group work as I found it difficult to work with my group,"W=I had a group of people who were a lot more lazy than me in the amount of work willing to put in therefore I felt we scored lower than my average - and I know others who feel the same, which is very frustrating",Being able to choose group members
CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,3,Not answered,2,Only challenging in terms of creating the video using a specific software,S=allocated roles to specific people so everyone was critically engaged W=unclear instructions; not sure how to incorporate the 'essay' element of the assignment,Longer film time
CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,4,3,4,2,4,3,3,2,Didn't know what made good film,2,Not answered,S=team;iMovie skills W=feedback not great,Feedback face to face
CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,4,3,4,4,4,3,3,1,Not answered,1,Not answered,S=enjoyable to undertake. Allowed a variety of techniques rather than just essays. W=hard to work as a group when certain group members didn't (co-op?),No
CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,4,3,4,4,4,5,5,3,There were some parts we found more difficult but we never asked for advice we just battled through,1,It was challenging but fun,S=allowed us to meet new people. Learnt new skills. Was a fun alternative. W=it took more time. Had to learn new skills.,Give us longer to do it. Have the briefing earlier.

CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,4,3,2,3,4,3,2,2,I didn't feel we were given enough guidance on using the film software; luckily one person in our group knew it very well. We didn't see an example film,2,Does not identify successfully what each person in the group did; some carried more weight than others,"W=the people who went over the time limit got on average higher marks, despite us being told marks would be docked for going over",Not answered
CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,3,3,3,2,3,4,2,1,Lectures & labs & re-assurance from lecturers/staff that they would be happy to help with queries,2,Didn't need to do much extensive reading or anything 'typically' academic. Constructing interviews and questionnaires fairly simple,S=nature of film needed more people to complete for workload W=not sure there was much gain to skills,Need a more clear purpose to it --> get more out of it. Film also quite abstract & most probs won't use again in diss/general.
CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,4,3,4,4,4,5,5,2,More guidance on film makingƒ,2,Does not fully cover full aspectsƒ,W=freerider problem,Not answered
CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,4,2,4,4,1,4,5,2,"Because we weren't told how to make a film, and how to structure it",2,We didn't find it geographically academic. As opposed to an essay or exam.,W=freeriders. It is not expected in a geography degree.,More assistance/guidance

CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,3,2,4,4,3,2,2,1,Instructions were clear,2,It limited your abilitty to read around the subject due to limited amount you could say,W=everyone got same mark - some didn't put as much effort in,Distribution in who did what
CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,4,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,"Despite a clear title/topic, there wasn't much guidance on what was expected from our films and we hadn't seen an example to give us any indication",2,I do not feel it really tested much academic knowledge at all,"W=because the groups were pre-selected, it was potentially harder to work together just because not everyone had the same work ethic and not all group members were as involved or efficient as others",It was interesting to carry out the research and learn more about interviewing people however I feel it wasn't great that it was 100% of the assessment
CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,4,2,2,1,3,4,3,3,I felt that there could have been more support/guidance on how to make a good film --> perhaps being shown an example one would have helped us to know more clearly what our outcome was supposed to be,2,Not answered,S=gained different interview skills --> helpful for research questions W=there was a variation within the group of how much effort people put in,I would have preferred to work in a group with people I knew
CPLAN,Developing Research Methods I,Group film project,3,1,1,1,1,4,4,2,Not enough advice on filming techniques,2,Written work is better for testing what we have learnt,S=experience interviewing people --> techniques for dissertation/research project (planning) W=nuiscance working as a group with people who perhaps don't care as much about the work and then given a group mark. Marked on quality of film when not given any filming equipment or microphones,Choose your groups. Help if feedback could be provided during the project to improve results.
